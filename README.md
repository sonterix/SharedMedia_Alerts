# SharedMedia Alerts

## Overview
SharedMedia Alerts is a comprehensive bundle of sound alerts designed to enhance your WoW gaming experience. These sounds are created to:

- Increase situational awareness
- Provide easy-to-understand information
- Assist in various gameplay scenarios like Raids, Mythic+, and Delves

## Primary Use Cases
This addon is particularly useful when integrated with popular WoW addons such as:

- BigWigs / LittleWigs
- Deadly Boss Mods (DBM)
- WeakAuras
- Plater (for sounds alerts)

and much more.

## Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from [SharedMedia_Causese](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sharedmedia_causese), expanding upon its sounds to provide a rich library of audio alerts.

## Features
- Wide variety of distinct sound alerts
- Integration with the majority of WoW addons
- Highlighted in orange in the list of sounds

## Customization
While SharedMedia Alerts provides a curated set of sounds, I'm always looking to expand the library with useful additions. If you have ideas for more generally useful sounds, please let me know in the comments section. Your input is valuable in making this addon even more helpful for the community.
